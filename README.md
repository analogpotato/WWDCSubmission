# ScanSpeak
### WWDC 2020 Submission by Frank Foster

### Purpose

This is my first Swift Playgrounds experience, let alone my first WWDC Student Submission. I decided to create a document scanner with OCR and Speech technology in order to scan and speak back text of written documents. This is a simple app that can do just that!

### Technology used

- `AVFoundation` - Used for `AVSpeechSynthesis` and generating the voice
- `Vision` - Tech for text recognition
- `VisionKit` - Underlying technology used for the document scanner
