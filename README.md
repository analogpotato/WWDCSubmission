# ScanSpeak
### WWDC 2020 Submission by Frank Foster

### Purpose

This is my first Swift Playgrounds experience, let alone my first WWDC Student Submission. I decided to create a document scanner with OCR and Speech technology in order to scan and speak back text of written documents. This is a simple app that can do just that!

### Technology used

- `AVFoundation` - Used for `AVSpeechSynthesis` and generating the voice
- `Vision` - Tech for text recognition
- `VisionKit` - Underlying technology used for the document scanner

### How to use

1. Download Swift Playgrounds on your iPad
2. Download the .zip file in this repository
3. Unzip the file and move it to your iPad
4. Launch Swift Playgrounds and open the .playgrounds file in the zip
